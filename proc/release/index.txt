Release Procedure
=================

Extremely draft.

At top-level...

Edit ``setup.py`` for new version number.  Then ``git commit`` and ``git push`` this.

Get release notes into ``README.txt`` somehow.

Get the latest git change hash::

    git log -n1 | sed q

(this is called *CHANGE* below)

Change to a directory where you can checkout a fresh copy of the sources
into a subdirectory.  You can delete it later if you want.

Checkout the particular revision of the source::

    git clone git://github.com/drj11/pypng.git pypng-X.Y.Z
    cd pypng-X.Y.Z
    git checkout CHANGE

(note the above cd's into the subdirectory)
  
Build the documentation (you will need sphinx installed)::

  python build.py

Make source distribution using Python distutils::

  python setup.py sdist

It's possible at this point that you might want to smoke-test the actual
release binary.  Let's assume that the release binary is good to go.

Move the dist binary that ``sdist`` just created, back into your main
development directory::

  mv dist/pypng-X.Y.Z.tar.gz ../pypng/dist

Create a zip for the documentation:

  cd html
  zip -r ../pypng-X.Y.Z-doc.zip .

Login to PyPI and go to "pypng" on the "Your packages" display.  Upload
documentation zip file. (Often doesn't work, because of buggy server.)

Upload to PyPI:

  python setup.py sdist upload

(If it complains about "you must be identified" then use
"python setup.py register" first)

cd back into your main development directory::

  cd ../pypng

Make a record in ``release/index.txt``

Upload ``dist/pypng-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`` to github.
